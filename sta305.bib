	abstract = {The performance of statistical methods is often evaluated by means of simulation studies. In case of network meta-analysis of binary data, however, simulations are not currently available for many practically relevant settings. We perform a simulation study for sparse networks of trials under between-trial heterogeneity and including multi-arm trials. Results of the evaluation of two popular frequentist methods and a Bayesian approach using two different prior specifications are presented. Methods are evaluated using coverage, width of intervals, bias, and root mean squared error (RMSE). In addition, deviations from the theoretical surface under the cumulative rankings (SUCRAs) or P-scores of the treatments are evaluated. Under low heterogeneity and when a large number of trials informs the contrasts, all methods perform well with respect to the evaluated performance measures. Coverage is observed to be generally higher for the Bayesian than the frequentist methods. The width of credible intervals is larger than those of confidence intervals and is increasing when using a flatter prior for between-trial heterogeneity. Bias was generally small, but increased with heterogeneity, especially in netmeta. In some scenarios, the direction of bias differed between frequentist and Bayesian methods. The RMSE was comparable between methods but larger in indirectly than in directly estimated treatment effects. The deviation of the SUCRAs or P-scores from their theoretical values was mostly comparable over the methods but differed depending on the heterogeneity and the geometry of the investigated network. Multivariate meta-regression or Bayesian estimation using a half-normal prior scaled to 0.5 seems to be promising with respect to the evaluated performance measures in network meta-analysis of sparse networks.},

	abstract = {Substantial COVID-19 research investment has been allocated to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, which currently face recruitment challenges or early discontinuation. We aim to estimate the effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on survival in COVID-19 from all currently available RCT evidence, published and unpublished. We present a rapid meta-analysis of ongoing, completed, or discontinued RCTs on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment for any COVID-19 patients (protocol: https://osf.io/QESV4/). We systematically identified unpublished RCTs (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Cochrane COVID-registry up to June 11, 2020), and published RCTs (PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv up to October 16, 2020). All-cause mortality has been extracted (publications/preprints) or requested from investigators and combined in random-effects meta-analyses, calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), separately for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. Prespecified subgroup analyses include patient setting, diagnostic confirmation, control type, and publication status. Sixty-three trials were potentially eligible. We included 14 unpublished trials (1308 patients) and 14 publications/preprints (9011 patients). Results for hydroxychloroquine are dominated by RECOVERY and WHO SOLIDARITY, two highly pragmatic trials, which employed relatively high doses and included 4716 and 1853 patients, respectively (67\% of the total sample size). The combined OR on all-cause mortality for hydroxychloroquine is 1.11 (95\% CI: 1.02, 1.20; I² = 0\%; 26 trials; 10,012 patients) and for chloroquine 1.77 (95\%CI: 0.15, 21.13, I² = 0\%; 4 trials; 307 patients). We identified no subgroup effects. We found that treatment with hydroxychloroquine is associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients, and there is no benefit of chloroquine. Findings have unclear generalizability to outpatients, children, pregnant women, and people with comorbidities.},
